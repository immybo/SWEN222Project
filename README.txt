GAME BACKGROUND

Pupo and Yelo, two lovable anthropomorphic blobs, have lost each other!
Oh no! It's your quest to reunite the pair, battling through an incredibly
difficult (/s) puzzle adventure game. The two players must progress through
the levels until they reunite by standing next to one another.

RUNNING THE GAME

To run the game, first run Server (under the network.server package),
then run Main (default package) twice. Connect to the server with
the button in the bottom-right. Both clients must be connected before
anything will happen.

CONTROLS & GAME INFO

W and S move the controlled character forwards and backwards. A and D
rotate the character counterclockwise and clockwise. Alternatively, you
can left click anywhere on the map, and the character will attempt to move
there. If the character can't move there, nothing will happen. If you left
click on an enemy, the character will attempt to attack it.

Right clicking on some objects will bring up a menu of interactions only
if that player is next to that object.The player can invoke an interaction
on that object; for example, a gate might have an unlock interaction. Left
click any of the interactions in the menu to activate it.

Items are automatically picked up when the player walks over them, if the
player has room in their inventory.

Portals may be moved through to teleport the player between zones. Only 
objects in the current zone will be drawn, and Pupo and Yelo may start in
different zones.

OBJECTIVE

Once Pupo and Yelo are on adjacent tiles to one another, the game will end
in victory.
